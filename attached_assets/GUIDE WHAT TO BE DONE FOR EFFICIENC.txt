GUIDE WHAT TO BE DONE FOR EFFICIENCY AND MODERNIZATION?
Efficiency (runtime and memory)

    Cache expensive work: use st.cache_data for pure calculations and st.cache_resource for ezdxf style/layer setup and any heavy objects.
    Lazy-load modules: import specific modules.* only when selected (reduce initial load, memory).
    Batch DXF entities: create blocks for repeated geometry (ties, gridlines) and insert as references; minimize per-entity text/dimension calls inside tight loops.
    Vectorize math: ensure loops in utils/calculations.py use NumPy operations where beneficial; precompute constants.
    Avoid repeated style setup: move layer/dimstyle creation into a single cached initializer and reuse.
    Defer downloads: generate DXF/report only after submit, not on every rerun.

Modern architecture and code quality

    Add type hints across codebase; run mypy in CI.
    Enforce style/quality with ruff (lint + format) and black.
    Extract constants and magic numbers to utils/constants.py.
    Introduce domain models with dataclasses/pydantic for validated inputs.
    Split modules/ into subpackages (columns, beams, roads) for clarity.

Streamlit app structure and UX

    Use native multipage via pages/ directory; each tool becomes a page instead of manual radios.
    Add input schemas and validation messages; disable submit until valid.
    Provide presets/templates for common designs; add a “Reset to defaults”.
    Use st.tabs within pages for Inputs / Results / CAD / Report.
    Zip downloads: bundle DXF + report in one download.
    Persist user choices with st.session_state; add “Copy permalink” (query params).

Testing and reliability

    Unit tests for utils/calculations.py (pytest, parametrized cases).
    Golden-file tests for DXF: generate, audit with ezdxf.audit, and compare entity counts/attributes.
    Smoke test Streamlit with Playwright (headless) to ensure pages load.
    Add python -m py_compile, ruff, mypy, and tests to CI.

CI/CD and automation

    GitHub Actions: matrix for 3.10–3.12; cache pip; run lint/type/test; attach artifacts (DXF samples).
    Dependabot/Renovate for dependency updates with auto-PRs.
    Pre-commit hooks: ruff, black, mypy, pyproject-fmt.

Deployment and packaging

    Pin versions (avoid floating “>=”) for reproducibility.
    Provide Dockerfile and optional devcontainer.json.
    Add README deploy section and streamlit config notes; include screenshots.

Security and robustness

    Sanitize filenames for downloads; avoid unsafe paths.
    Validate numeric ranges rigorously; guard divide-by-zero and unit mistakes.
    Add a central error handler utility; log with logging to a file and optionally Sentry.

Documentation

    Expand README.md with features, quickstart, module matrix, and examples.
    API docs for utilities via mkdocs or pdoc.
    Include engineering references (IS codes) and assumptions per module.
